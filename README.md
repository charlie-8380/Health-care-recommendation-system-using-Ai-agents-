🩺 Personalized Healthcare Recommendation System using AI

An AI-powered Healthcare Recommendation System that predicts diseases based on user-reported symptoms and provides personalized treatment, diet, precautions, and medication suggestions — combining Machine Learning, NLP (BERT), and LLMs for a user-friendly health assistant experience.

🚀 Project Overview

This system allows users to input symptoms and receive intelligent health predictions along with actionable recommendations. Built using advanced AI models and streamlined UI, the system is designed for early diagnosis support, health awareness, and personalized care guidance.

🔍 Key Features
	•	🔬 Disease Prediction using Machine Learning and BERT-based NLP
	•	🧠 AI-generated Recommendations for:
	•	Medications 💊
	•	Diet Plans 🥗
	•	Precautions ⚠️
	•	Doctor Specializations 👨‍⚕️
	•	🌐 Interactive Interface built with Streamlit
	•	📈 Symptom-to-Disease Mapping using trained datasets
	•	💬 Conversational logic using LLMs (e.g., GPT-style agents)

🛠️ Tech Stack
	•	Python 3
	•	Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch
	•	Transformers (BERT) – for symptom understanding
	•	LangChain / LLM APIs – for personalized recommendations
	•	Streamlit – for front-end interface
	•	Matplotlib / Plotly – for data visualization (if used)

🧠 How It Works
	1.	User inputs symptoms through the UI.
	2.	Disease prediction model (ML/NLP) processes input and predicts probable condition(s).
	3.	Recommendation engine (powered by LLMs or curated datasets) provides:
	•	Suggested medicines
	•	Dietary guidelines
	•	Safety precautions
